# CocoCoin
CocoCoin is a simple application based on Web3 that allows you to mint a memecoin in the Goerli Test Network. The project was made as an assignment for the Cadena's Ethereum 101 Course. To build this project, I developed and deployed the Solidity contract using the RemixIDE and created the front end using NextJS and Material UI.
# Live Demo
The app is live and deployed in this [site](https://cococoin.vercel.app).
